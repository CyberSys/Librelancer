# Generating .3db icons

To generate a .3db icon, choose **Toolsâ†’Generate Icon**, then select your image file in the dialog. The image must have dimensions that are square and powers of two (e.g. 32x32, 128x128, 256x256).

- **Compress** - Tick to compress the icon using DXT5 compression. This reduces the size of the icon on disk and in VRAM at the expense of slight compression artifacts. Check your icon in the Model Viewer or in-game to confirm that the quality is acceptable if you enable this.
- **Icon Name** - Sets the base name for the icon texture and material nodes.
